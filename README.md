ecustools
================

**OBS!**

This package is **deprecated** and this repository will be made read-only and
archived in due time!

Please migrate to the successor packages listed below!

Originally, **ecustools** consisted of a miscellaneous collection of R functions
used in the ECUS group for working with time-series and paleo data, with many of
the functions having been ported from the 'paleoLibrary' collection of R
scripts.

Most of the package's original content was now migrated to a set of smaller,
more structured and theme-oriented packages, superseding **ecustools**:

* [pfields](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/pfields): handling and
  analysis of gridded field data;
* [grfxtools](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/grfxtools): assistance
  for various plotting tasks;
* [geostools](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/geostools): assistance
  for handling geoscientific problems;
* [stattools](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/stattools): tools for
  statistical analyses;
* [prxytools](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/prxytools): assistance
  for proxy analyses;
* [ncdftools](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/ncdftools): handling of
  NetCDF files;
* [orbitalforcing](https://github.com/EarthSystemDiagnostics/orbitalforcing):
  calculation of climate orbital forcing.
