A miscellaneous collection of R functions used in the ECUS group for working with time-series and paleo data. 

Many of these functions have been ported from the 'paleoLibrary' collection of R scripts.

This R package is not on CRAN, to install:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EarthSystemDiagnostics/ecustools")
```
